## MC Generated Data

The Generated Data are all the internal files used by Minecraft (don't act like you don't know what it is). The files can be the textures, block models, NBT structure files, recipes, tags and many others more technical, like the files for the world generation.
In addition to the Minecraft files, the folder `lists` contains text and json files which allows to compare more easily some very technical changes.

This repository contain the generated data for all version. For a repository which allows to compare the different versions, especially the last one, go to [generated-data-latest](https://github.com/un-pogaz/MC-generated-data-latest)
